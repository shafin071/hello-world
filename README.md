# hello-world
A dummy eLearning website built with django, JavaScript, Bootstrap with various other tools to provide user experience as a student. Hosted with Heroku and AWS S3

## Situation:
Wanted to come up with a project so I could learn full-stack application development in the process

## Task:
Built a demo eLearning website

## Planning:



The analysis notebook consists of 6 segments:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Train-Test Split
4. Creating an ANN Model with TF and Keras
5. Evaluating Model Performance
6. Prediction

## Result:
Model predicted loan outcome with **0.94 precision** and **0.93 recall**

## Resources used for this project:
* 90MB LendingCLub Dataset
* Google Colab Notebook
* Python v3
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Imblearn (for balancing dataset)
* Tensorflow / Keras
